/// <summary>An example Class that imports an IFC model on Start(). </summary>
/// <remarks>To run the demo, you need to
/// 1) Ensure you've completed the installation guide in the README.
/// 2) Ensure RuntimeImportDemo.cs is attached to a GameObject in the opened scene.
/// 3) Place an ifc file you wish to test inside the project folder.
/// 4) Edit the assetPath and filename below to point to your ifc-file.
/// 5) Press play. Your building should appear after a few seconds.
/// You can also build and run the scene. For this you should make sure both your ifc-file and IfcConvert executable are in the resulting build folder and the assetPath and the filename below are still correct.
///
/// In other words you need to:
/// 1. Create a folder named "Assets" in your build folder.
/// 2. Copy IfcConvert.exe into the Assets folder
/// 3. Create a folder named "IfcImporter" in the Assets folder
/// 4. Create a folder named "Demo" in the IfcImporter folder
/// 5. Copy demo_duplex.ifc to the Demo folder.
/// </remarks>
